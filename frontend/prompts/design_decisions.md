# Frontend Design Decisions

## Architecture
- React for UI library
- TypeScript for type safety
- Vite for build tooling and development server
- React Router for client-side routing
- Context API for state management

## Code Style
- Use functional components with hooks
- Follow ESLint configurations
- Use consistent naming conventions:
  - PascalCase for components
  - camelCase for variables and functions
  - UPPER_SNAKE_CASE for constants
- Import ordering: React, libraries, components, hooks, utils

## Project Structure
- `/components` - Reusable UI components
- `/pages` - Route-level components
- `/context` - React Context providers
- `/hooks` - Custom React hooks
- `/services` - API service functions
- `/utils` - Utility functions
- `/types` - TypeScript type definitions

## Styling Approach
- CSS modules for component-specific styling
- Consider using a UI component library if needed

## Authentication
- JWT-based authentication
- Protected routes with React Router
- Auth context for global auth state

## Testing
- Jest for unit testing
- React Testing Library for component testing

## Mapping Components
- Consider using Leaflet, MapboxGL, or OpenLayers for mapping functionality
- Separate map logic into custom hooks for reusability

## Performance Considerations
- Lazy loading for routes
- Memoization for expensive calculations
- Virtualization for long lists

## Accessibility
- Follow WCAG 2.1 guidelines
- Use semantic HTML
- Ensure keyboard navigation
- Provide alt text for images

## Production Considerations
- Error boundaries for graceful failure
- Environment-based configuration
- Docker containerization
